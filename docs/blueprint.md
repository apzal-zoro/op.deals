## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark Gold (#B8860B), evoking a sense of hidden treasure in the darkness.
- Background color: Dark Slate Gray (#2F4F4F), providing a subdued and mysterious backdrop for the pixel art.
- Accent color: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF), used for highlighting interactive elements and calls to action to make them pop against the dark background.
- Body and headline font: 'Press Start 2P' (pixel-style) for headlines and body text to maintain the retro aesthetic.
- Use pixel-style icons throughout the app to maintain the retro gaming aesthetic, ensuring they are easily visible against the dark background.
- Mimic retro game layouts with clear sections and easy navigation. PC version feels like SNES game UI; Mobile mimics GameBoy layout, optimized for dark theme visibility.
- Incorporate 8-bit click sounds and subtle glow animations for buttons and interactions to enhance the retro feel and provide feedback in the dark environment.
